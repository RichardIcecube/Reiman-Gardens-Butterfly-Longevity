## Name
Butterfly Longevity Project

## Description
A web application used to track the lifespan of butterflies. This is accomplished by tagging each tracked butterfly with a physical sticker on their wings that has a designated alphacode on it. Researchers (classified as Admins) use the web app to register each individual butterfly recording its species and its alphacode. These registered butterflies are then let out into an enclosure where they spend the rest of their lifespans flying around in. Visitors (classified as Docent and Public) can then visit these enclosures and report sightings of these butterflies by reading their alphacode and typing them into the web app. The data collected includes the date the butterfly was registered, the species of the butterfly (both common and scientific names), the date the butterfly was last reported, the number of times the butterfly was reported, if the butterfly is alive or dead, and the date the butterfly died. Using the collected data, admins can generate a report of the collected data based on parameters set by the admin. This allows the admin to view the collected data in a comprehensive format that can be used in presentations in the future.

## Installation
How to Setup Server
1) Login to AWS EC2 instance using AWS permission key (will need to regenerate a key and reassign if needed)
    - Command: ssh -i ReimanLongevityKey.pem ec2-user@ec2-3-137-208-248.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com


2) Stop the current nginx frontend server
    - Command: sudo systemctl stop nginx

3) Stop the current backend server
    - Command: sudo systemctl stop springServer

4) Make sure the java springboot application.properties url is pointed to the right database
    - spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://logevitydatabase.clfwwirs6cmp.us-east-2.rds.amazonaws.com:3306/butterflyDB

5) Cd into the current frontend (...\butterfly_7\Frontend\my-app) on local computer

6) Run npm run build

7) Copy frontend files to ec2 instance
    - Command: scp -r -i ReimanLongevityKey.pem Frontend/build/ ec2-user@ec2-3-137-208-248.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:~

8) Cd into the backend folder

9) Run mvn clean package

10) Cd into the target folder

11) Copy backend jar into ec2 instance
    - scp -r -i ReimanLongevityKey.pem Backend/target/springboot-demo-1.0.0.jar ec2-user@ec2-3-137-208-248.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:~

12) Login to AWS EC2 instance using AWS permission key (will need to regenerate a key and reassign if needed)
    - Command: ssh -i ReimanLongevityKey.pem ec2-user@ec2-3-137-208-248.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com

13) Restart the backend:
    -   Command: sudo systemctl restart springServer
    - Note: This uses a service script I wrote

14) Restart the frontend nginx sever
    - Command: sudo systemctl restart nginx
